You can run the command:

'python2.7 autograder.py'

from the 'tutorials' folder to see 3/3 correctly solved problems.  Note that you can use:

'python2.7 autograder.py -- mute'

to get rid of distracting print statements.

The Advanced Exercise (quick sort) can be found in the same directory as this README, and is named 'quickSort-dev'

'listcomp-dev' is just a bonus practice script for learning list syntax.

Note that you can run the pacman project from windows bash.

From windows bash, make sure you have python2.7 installed.
You must also have xming installed on your windows host.
If running 'python2.7 pacman.py' gives you a python-tk error then you can sudo apt install python-tk.

It should now run on windows bash.
